This portrait was to include a picture of our interviewee as the main focal point of the portrait and images surrounding that. These images were to represent things said in the interview such as historical places and important points. A couple of images that I chose included pictures from the coast of California and Mexico, as these were places she remembered vividly and had a overall nice aesthetic to the portrait. Most of the images were stock images from the internet including that of a Special Ed. teacher and images of strict parents or learning spanish, which all were important things said in the interview. The portrait was comprised of 25 images all of which had to represent something within the interviewee. This leads directly into my second point of sizing of the images. To be frank, this really didn’t quite come across to me at the time and wasn’t a significant part or had a direct influence to do with images. The sizing specifically had only aesthetic value and or just at random. This has do with any other placing of images. 			</p>			<hr>			<p>Below, I show my essay that I made for Humanities that was made from a topic from our interview.</p>				<br>				<br>			<div class="noelessay">				<a href="images/Essay1.JPG"><img src="images/Essay1.JPG"></a>			</div>			<div class="noelessay">				<a href="images/Essay2.JPG"><img src="images/Essay2.JPG"></a>			</div>			<div class="noelessay">				<a href="images/Essay3.JPG"><img src="images/Essay3.JPG"></a>			</div>			<div class="noelessay">				<a href="images/Essay4.JPG"><img src="images/Essay4.JPG"></a>			</div>				<hr>			<p>This is an addition to the website.
